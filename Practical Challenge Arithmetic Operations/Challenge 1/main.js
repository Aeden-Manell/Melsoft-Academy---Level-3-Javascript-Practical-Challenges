// This JavaScript program performs arithmetic operations on two given numbers, num1 and num2.


// The program initializes num1 and num2 with chosen values.
let num1 = 20;
let num2 = 8;

/* Using basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), 
it calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of num1 and num2. */
// The results of these operations are then printed to the console as the output.
console.log(num1 + num2); 
console.log(num1 - num2); 
console.log(num1 * num2); 
console.log(num1 / num2);
